Small webserver projects made during my time spent at Bootcamp. This project was made around the 5th week. 

Made by - Miguel Marques Sarmento e Silva Franco

This simple chatserver is made to work with netcat as a client. 
It has several ascii commands such as /rat, /heart and /quit. Try them out!
